<h1>Natours</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
This is a full-stack tours booking application I built as part of the NodeJS Complete Bootcamp course on Udemy.

The application includes a robust, user-friendly frontend and a comprehensive backend API for sending data and communicating with the frontend.

Users may signup, login, view and book tours with real authentication using JSON web tokens and Stripe card processing in a test enviroment.

All data comes from the live database and users may change account information at any time.
